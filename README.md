## 🔒 Private Chat Feature – Exclusive Patch-Only Messaging

This patch introduces a powerful new feature to enhance player communication: **Private Chat**, available *only* to users running this patch.

---

### 🔹 What It Does

- Allows **unfiltered messaging** through a dedicated private channel.
- Uses a **special purple send message button**, located next to the regular send button, to send **Private Messages**.
- Messages are only visible to **other players who also have this patch installed** — ensuring modded users can communicate discreetly.
- Messages appear in a **custom pink chat bubble** so you can easily identify other Private Chat users.
- **SHIFT+ENTER Shortcut** added (thanks to Glockoma!) – quickly send Private Messages without clicking the button.

---

### ⚠️ Important Notes

- **USE AT YOUR OWN RISK** – This bypasses standard filters and may violate server terms of service.
- **DO NOT press Enter or the default Send button** unless you mean to send a public message.
- Always use the **purple Private Chat button** or **SHIFT+ENTER** for private messaging.
- If your recipient **does not have the patch**, they will **not see** your private messages.
